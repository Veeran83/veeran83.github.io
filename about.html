                       <h2> Career Objective : </h2><p>Work hard using all my skills, protecting my country by developing and securing IT infrastructure and improve myself.</p> 
                        <h2>About: </h2>
                        <p>The moment I saw my computer I was so excited to use it. When I used it for the first time I was completely astounded by its speed and the way it works. This is the instance that provoked me to learn more about computers. During my higher secondary education, I started to learn about computers. As I came to know more and more about computers the next thing that captivated me was software. Softwares are like the results of computers through which we can use a computer proficiently. When I came to know more about software and the way they work I became familiar with programming. After learning to program, I built a couple of websites like the one I have to describe myself and some projects using Python, Java, Javascript, HTML, and SQL. Gradually Softwares and websites made me realize how many people use these services and with billions of devices now online, new threats pop-up every second. </p>

                        <p>Interestingly 90% of the data in the world was generated in the past two years(2018 and 2019) which also means that there is a huge need for security and privacy now more than ever. This blew my mind and I know that there are many services where security is a must and this is where my role comes into play. I have developed a passion for hacking, using which I can help many services protect themselves from Black Hat Hackers(harmful hackers). There is a huge need for White Hat Hackers(Good or Ethical Hackers) who can protect many services and businesses from Black Hat Hackers in India especially because I personally had many experiences where there is a lack of CyberSecurity. My real time work experience as an information security analyst gave me more practical exposure and made me understand how the scenario is in the outside world. It is my dream to become a Cyber Security Specialist.</p>
